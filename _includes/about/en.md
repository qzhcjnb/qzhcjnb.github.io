Hello, my name is Qin Zihan (QZH).  
Currently, my main interest lies in web development.  
Although for now I can only use open-source frameworks to build websites,  
I truly enjoy the process of bringing creativity to life through code.  
Even though I am still in the learning phase, I am very curious about technology,  
and I am willing to continuously try new tools and methods to improve my skillset.  
In the future, I hope to master both front-end and back-end technologies and gradually work independently on small projects.
